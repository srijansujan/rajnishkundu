His father owns this small fruit shop and supports the family with the meagre earnings. After securing 85.7% in his Madhyamik, Rajnish received free coaching from an organisation based in Habra when he was in the 11th and 12th grade. His perseverance paid off when he scored 84.6% in the H.S Examinations and got admitted to Barasat Govt. College for a bachelor’s in Physics in 2015. Srijan Sujan has extended its full support to Rajnish since 2015. </p>",
